Header only library for analyzing Starcraft 2 maps by region decomposition. Based on the \href{http://bwem.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Brood War Easy Map architecture} created by Igor Dimitrijevic. It uses the M\+IT license.

\subsection*{Getting started}

Overseer is header only, you just need to include the folder anywhere in your source folder to use it. Include the file {\ttfamily \hyperlink{MapImpl_8h_source}{Map\+Impl.\+h}} into your project to get started.

{\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}\+Overseer/\+Map\+Impl.\+h\char`\"{}}

You need to pass a pointer to your Agent to the map to have it fully configured. Then you need to call {\ttfamily Intialize()} to construct the map. Now you\textquotesingle{}re good to go! This is how it would look on Interloper LE


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{c++\}
2 \{
3     Overseer::MapImpl map;
4 
5     map.setBot(&bot); //Pass a pointer to your sc2::Agent
6     map.Initialize(); //Intialize the map
7 
8     std::cout << "Number of tiles on map: " << map.size() << std::endl;
9     std::cout << "Number of regions: " << map.getRegions().size() << std::endl;
10 \}
\end{DoxyCode}


Example output\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 Number of tiles on map: 26752
2 Number of regions: 18
\end{DoxyCode}


If you want the number of {\ttfamily Choke\+Point} you have to check for each region pair since a pair of regions could have multiple {\ttfamily Choke\+Point} \subsection*{Project status}
